honestly this has made me want to switch to backend. This entire process was a pain and i'm not sure if my skillset
involves playing around with css, I enjoy figuring out the logic puzzles in JS but im not sure if its worth learning JS if I even have to do any CSS.
my project is what it is. I didn't get to finish it, mostly because my image box wouldn't load in the mobile config so i just made its height 0px so it didnt get in the way. I think its somewhat responsive and works on mobile so it meets the basic requirements.
