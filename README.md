# static-comp-1
honestly this has made me want to switch to backend. This entire process was a pain and i'm not sure if my skillset
involves playing around with css, I enjoy figuring out the logic puzzles in JS but im not sure if its worth learning JS if I even have to do CSS.
my project is bad. I didnt get to finish it, mostly because my image box wouldn't load in the mobile config.
I'm not really sure what else to say other than it is what it is.
